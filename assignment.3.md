## ECE 565 Programming Assignment 3 Fall 2023
We are moving to the ARM ISA for these tasks. You will have to rebuild gem5 to use the ARM target ISA.

For this assignment you should focus on the *MinorCPU* Model located in /src/cpu/minor. The *MinorCPU* currently models a simple pipelined.  (Hint: Use the -h flag with your Python script to find out how to specify the CPU model you use.)
    One caveat of this CPU model is that each pipeline stage/component inherits from an abstracted resource object. As with every resource, there is the contingency of encountering a structural hazard. The occurrence of a structural hazard is dependent on the width of the corresponding stage. Thus in order to model one outstanding instruction per stage, you have to adjust the width of each stage to be 1 (*hint: look inside MinorCPU.py*).
    
A nice overview of MinorCPU can be found here: https://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/cpu_models/minor_cpu

For this part and the following part (split execution stage) you should use the ARM build of gem5. Make sure you are building the ARM version using the command line:

```console
scons-3 USE_HDF5=0 -j `nproc` ./build/ECE565-ARM/gem5.opt
```

1. **Examine CPU types (ARM)**

    There are several different types of CPUs that gem5 supports: atomic, timing, out-of-order, inorder and kvm. Let's talk about the timing and the inorder cpus. The timing CPU (also known as SimpleTimingCPU) executes each arithmetic instruction in a single cycle, but requires multiple cycles for memory accesses. Also, it is not pipelined. So only a single instruction is being worked upon at any time. The inorder cpu (also known as Minor) executes instructions in a pipelined fashion. It has the following pipe stages: fetch1, fetch2, decode and execute.

    Take a look at the file MinorCPU.py. In the definition of MinorFU, the class for functional units, we define two quantities opLat and issueLat. From the comments provided in the file, understand how these two parameters are to be used. Also note the different functional units that are instantiated as defined in class MinorDefaultFUPool.

    Assume that the issueLat and the opLat of the FloatSimdFU can vary from 1 to 6 cycles and that they always sum to 7 cycles. For each decrease in the opLat, we need to pay with a unit increase in issueLat. Which design of the FloatSimd functional unit would you prefer? Provide statistical evidence obtained through simulations of the unannotated daxpy. For these experiments, please use the pre-compiled arm binary for daxpy that's provided at `/home/yara/mithuna2/gem5-Fall2022/daxpy-armv7-binary`. (For all parts of the homework that use the ARM ISA, we are unable to cross-compile on ECN's x86 machines. As such, you **must** use precompiled binaries.)
    
    If you wish - you can use the following new configuration file that provides an example of how to extend the MinorCPU with options for op/issue latency. Other students have reportedly used other approaches instead of inheritance. Some have reported that they successfully copied the files and modified the copies. As long as you can (1) implement a new kind of CPU, and (2) implement the opLat/issueLat varying in the new CPU, you will have met the requirements. You are not bound to a specific method.

    """ CPU based on MinorCPU with options for a simple gem5 configuration script

    This file contains a CPU model based on MinorCPU that allows for a few options
    to be tweaked. 
    Specifically, issue latency, op latency, and the functional unit pool.

    See src/cpu/minor/MinorCPU.py for MinorCPU details.

    from m5.objects import MinorCPU, MinorFUPool
    from m5.objects import MinorDefaultIntFU, MinorDefaultIntMulFU
    from m5.objects import MinorDefaultIntDivFU, MinorDefaultFloatSimdFU
    from m5.objects import MinorDefaultMemFU, MinorDefaultFloatSimdFU
    from m5.objects import MinorDefaultMiscFU

    class MyFloatSIMDFU(MinorDefaultFloatSimdFU):

    # From MinorDefaultFloatSimdFU

        def __init__(self, options=None):

            if options and options.fpu_operation_latency:
                self.opLat = options.fpu_operation_latency

    class MyFUPool(MinorFUPool):
        def __init__(self, options=None):
            super(MinorFUPool, self).__init__()
            # Copied from src/mem/MinorCPU.py
            self.funcUnits = [MinorDefaultIntFU(), MinorDefaultIntFU(),
                            MinorDefaultIntMulFU(), MinorDefaultIntDivFU(),
                            MinorDefaultMemFU(), MinorDefaultMiscFU(),
                            # My FPU
                            MyFloatSIMDFU(options)]


    class MyMinorCPU(MinorCPU):
        def __init__(self, options=None):
            super(MinorCPU, self).__init__()
            self.executeFuncUnits = MyFUPool(options)

    ```
    
    To simulate workloads with the MinorCPU, you may use the following command (assuming that the daxpy-armv7-binary has been placed in `<gem5root>/part1`: 
    
    ```console
    ./build/ECE565-ARM/gem5.opt configs/example/se.py --cpu-type=MinorCPU --maxinsts=1000000 --l1d_size=64kB --l1i_size=16kB --caches --l2cache -c part1/daxpy-armv7-binary
    ```
    
    The command includes several options which are worth getting familiar with. E.g., options to change the CPU types, options to limit simulation to a given number of instructions, and options to include/configure caches in the simulation.
   

2. **Degrade Branch Prediction (ARM)**

The MinorCPU already implements a few branch predictor modules, including a tournament predictor and a simpler Branch Target Buffer (BTB). The pipeline timing enables you to figure out at the EX stage whether or not the branch prediction was correct. What you need to do is implement an option that will allow you to not only enable/disable the branch predictor, but degrade its accuracy to different levels as well.

Note that the pipeline already handles the squashing of instructions fetched from the wrong path. On a misprediction, the pipeline will initiate calls to update the corresponding branch predictor’s entry with the correct target address.

It would be functionally correct to squash the pending instructions if the predicted target is correct, but it would not be functionally correct to consider the branch correctly predicted when the predicted target does not match the actual branch target, and still consider it to be correct. For this part of the assignment, you need to implement a feature that degrades the branch predictor’s accuracy by treating some correctly predicted branches as incorrect. You will need to generate a random number between 0 and 1, and for a specified accuracy of X%, if the generated number is greater than X%, consider it a misprediction. Note that this "accuracy" is not the branch predictor’s accuracy, but the percentage of it’s original accuracy. That is, 100% would be equal to the default branch predictor’s accuracy, 50% would be half of the original predictor’s accuracy, and 0% would be an always incorrect predictor – it always predicts the wrong thing.

For this, you will need to run the benchmark simulations for those three "accuracies:"

* 100%
* 50%
* 0%

3. **Split Execution Stage (ARM)**

For this part, we want to be able to split up the Execution Unit into two stages. Modern pipelines employ deeper pipelines in order to increase the clock frequency. Instead of having a more complex stage that requires additional cycles, the corresponding stage is split into smaller stages, where each requires fewer cycles. However, as you know there is a trade-off for every design decision. What you need to do is split up the EX stage into EX1 + EX2 accordingly. The simplest way to do this is to create a "dummy" stage in front of the current execute that does nothing but pass the input tot EX stage along.


4. **Submission instructions**
    
The main deliverable of this assignment that will be graded is a report (and not the code). The code will still have to be submitted as a single patch for plagiarism checking. But the code is not what gets graded.
    
Submit a report (maximum three pages) with graphs and/or tables to present results via brightspace. Each graph should summarize the results of one of the experiments. (Suggested format: Plot bar-graphs with benchmarks on the X-axis and IPC on the Y-axis. For each benchmark, show two or more bars; one is the baseline and the rest correspond to your changes.) The report is NOT meant to be an exercise in writing. I do not expect any text beyond a 2-3 sentence summary of the key observations for each graph. However, this is a minimum and not a maximum. If you have text you want me to see (e.g., assumptions, simplifications, data-gathering difficulties etc.), feel free to write additional text in the report.
